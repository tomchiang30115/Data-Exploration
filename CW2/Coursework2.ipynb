Each task can have a concise lab report that is maximum of one page in an A4 size. You will be expected to submit your Jupyter Notebook and all lab reports as a single zip file. You could have additional functions implemented that you require for carrying out each task.\n"

    "In this task, you need to obtain sentiment analysis for the provided dataset. The dataset consists of movie reviews with the sentiments being provided. The sentiments are either positive or negative. You need to train an SVM based classifier to obtain train and check on the sample test dataset provided. The method will be evaluated also against an external test set. Please do not hardcode any dimensions or number of samples while writing the code. It should be possible to automate the testing and hardcoding values does not allow for automated testing. \n",
